# About Phantom

## Welcome to Phantom's World! 🕵️‍♂️✨

Hi there! I'm Phantom, your friendly (but slightly mischievous) web developer in training. I’m all about exploring the vast, mysterious realms of the internet—one line of buggy code at a time. 🚀

Now, between you and me, I might not be the most organized when it comes to my secrets... or my environment variables. 🤷‍♂️ But hey, learning is all about making mistakes, right? Just don’t go poking around too much—you never know what you might stumble across. (Not that there's anything important lying around... probably. 😅)

Anyway, have fun exploring my site! Who knows? Maybe you'll uncover a thing or two about me, my journey, or the interesting ways I’ve been managing my top-secret projects. Just remember: curiosity may have killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back. 😉

Stay curious,
Phantom

# About project
First off, yes, that was AI generated. 😶‍🌫️

My goal for this ctf was to make one that can be solved by anyone without taking
away from the difficulty of each step. Let me know how well I did on that!

Thank you [Harsh the Atomic
Potato](https://github.com/Uncannypotato69) for the design!

You can submit your flag and get hints [here](https://codingslothctf.me/)

Hop on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GRjXpWnX) if you'd like to get updated on the next one!

More work might be kept into this website in the coming year, but I figured I
should have something ready before the year ends

Have fun!

Stay curious,
Tayomide
